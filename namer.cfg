# How to write output file name.  When namer.py is run this is applied in place 
# (next to the file to be processed).
# When run from namer_watchdog.py this will be written in to the successdir.
#
# Supports stand python 3 formating, as well as: 
# * a prefix:
# {site: 1p} - in this case put one space in front of the 'site', so ' Vixen'
# * a suffix:
# {date:_1s} - in this case put one underscore after the 'date', so '2020-01-01_'
# * an infix:
# {date:_2i} - in this case put two underscore before and after the 'date', so '__2020-01-01__'
#
# Examples: 
# * {site} - {date} - {scene}.{ext}
# * {site}/{date}.{scene}.{ext}
#
# Missing values will be ignored.
#
# Allowed replacements:
#
# * 'date' - in the format of YYYY-MM-DD.
# * 'description' - too long, don't use in a name.
# * 'name' - the scene name
# * 'site' - the site name, BrazzersExxtra, AllHerLuv, Deeper, etc with spaces removed.
# * 'full_site' - the site name from porndb, unmodified, i.e: Brazzers Exxtra, All Her Luv, etc.
# * 'performers' - space seperated list of female performers
# * 'all_performers' - space seperated list of all performers
# * 'act' - an act, parsed from original file name, don't use.
# * 'ext' - original file's extension, you should keep this.
# * 'trans' - 'TS', or 'ts' if detected in original file name.
#
# This must not contain paths, as files will be processed in place when called on the command line from namer.

# If a file is an mkv adding metadata at this time isn't supported.

# Should genres pulled from the porndb be added to the file?   These genres are noisey and
# not recommend for use.  If this is false a single default genere will be used.
