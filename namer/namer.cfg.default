# If you are running watchdog see new_relative_path_name in the watchdog section.
#
# Supports stand python 3 formatting, as well as:
# * a prefix:
# {site: 1p} - in this case put one space in front of the 'site', so ' Vixen'
# * a suffix:
# {date:_1s} - in this case put one underscore after the 'date', so '2020-01-01_'
# * an infix:
# {date:_2i} - in this case put two underscore before and after the 'date', so '__2020-01-01__'
#
# Examples:
# * {site} - {date} - {scene}.{ext}
# * {site}/{date}.{scene}.{ext}
#
# Missing values will be ignored.
#
# Allowed replacements:
#
# * 'date' - in the format of YYYY-MM-DD.
# * 'year' - just the year of the scene/movie.
# * 'description' - too long, don't use in a name.
# * 'name' - the scene/movie name
# * 'site' - the site or studio name, BrazzersExxtra, AllHerLuv, Deeper, etc with spaces removed.
# * 'full_site' - the full site/studio name from porndb, unmodified, i.e: Brazzers Exxtra, All Her Luv, etc.
# * 'parent' - the parent site/studio name from porndb, unmodified, i.e: Brazzers, etc.
# * 'full_parent' - the parent full site/studio name from porndb, unmodified, i.e: Brazzers, Vixen, etc.
# * 'network' - the network site or studio name, MindGeek, Vixen, etc with spaces removed.
# * 'full_network' - the network full site/studio name from porndb, unmodified, i.e: Mind Geek, Vixen, etc.
# * 'performers' - comma seperated list of female performers
# * 'all_performers' - comma seperated list of all performers
# * 'act' - an act, parsed from original file name, don't use.
# * 'ext' - original file's extension, you should keep this.
# * 'trans' - 'TS', or 'ts' if detected in original file name.
# * 'type' - "movie" or "scene" depending on tpdb api used to find the metadata (/scenes or /movies)
# * 'resolution' - 480p, 720p, 1080p, 4k, or any other integer
# * 'vr', is the studio is a known vr studio, 'vr', else '', can be used for folder names, like ../adult{vr}/..
